        <ul>
            <li>Character Variables/ Strings - A Character Variable or a string refers to a scalar value of a unicode character. For example, every letter is a character.</li>
            <pre class="code">str('C')</pre>
            <li>Factors - Although not exactly precise, one can think of factors as integers with labels. So, the underlying representation of a variable for sex is 1:2 with labels <q>Male</q> and <q>Female</q>. They are a special class with attributes, or metadata, that contains the information about the levels. While the underlying representation is numeric, it is important to remember that factors are categorical. They can't be used as numbers would be, as the following demonstrates. They are best used to represent repeating observations such as gender.</li>
            <pre class="code">factor('c', levels = 'c', labels = 'Cat')</pre>
            <li>Numeric Variables - Simplest one by far, any number can be used to represent numeric variables. These can be integers or whole numbers.</li>
            <pre class="code">2</pre>
            <li>Logical - Logical Vectors refer to True or False. There are certain Logical operators in R, that output a logical scalar.</li>
            <pre class="code">T</pre>
            <li>Vectors - Vectors are a combination of different scalar values. They are required to be homogenous.</li>
            <pre class="code">c(2,3,4,5,6)</pre>
            <li>Matrices - Matrices are extremely useful to represent data in a certain format, they are similar to dataframes, howoever they require that the data be homogenous.</li>
            <pre class="code">matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)</pre>
            <li>Data Frames - Data Frames can be used to represent datasets. A dataframe is similar to matrices however, it doesn't require that the data be homogenous. Hence, we can represent different data formats in a single grouping structure.</li>
            <pre class="code">data.frame(names = c('a', 'b'), scores = c(2,4))</pre>
            <li>Lists - Lists can be used to combine different types of data such as a vector, matrix and data frame in a single object. </li>
            <pre class="code">char <- 'c'
fac <- factor('c', levels = 'c', labels = 'Cat')
num <- 2
log <- T
vec <- c('a','b','c','d')

        <p class = "para">
            The more you learn about dates and times, the more
complicated they seem to get. To warm up, try these three seemingly
simple questions- </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does every year have 365 days?</li>
            <li>Does every day have 24 hours?</li>
            <li>Does every minute have 60 seconds?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">While it's easy to answer these questions, dates are a lot more complex to deal with in R. Some basic code to obtain the current date and time are listed below. <code>today()</code> gives you the current date, and <code>now()</code> gives you the current date and time.
        Before proceeding any further, you should load the lubridate library. </p>
        <p class="para">To create dates, we pass a string through one of the following three functions - </p>
        <ul>
            <pre class="code">library(lubridate)</pre>
            <li><code>ymd()</code> - Year, Month, Day</li>
            <pre class="code">ymd('2019-05-01')</pre>
            <li><code>dmy()</code> - Day, Month, Year</li>
            <pre class="code">dmy('01-05-2019')</pre>
            <li><code>mdy()</code> - Month, Day, Year</li>
            <pre class="code">mdy('05-01-2019')
mdy(January 5th, 2012)</pre>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">To further add the time component, we pass similar functions - </p>
        <pre class="code"> ymd_hms("2017-01-31 20:11:59")</pre>
        <p class="para">The main advantage of arranging in a date format compared to a character is sequence plotting or sequentially arranging the data which is extremely important.</p>

    <div class="regex">
        <h2 class = 'nav-title'>Regular Expressions</h2>
        <p class="para"> In this section, we will be working with Regular Expressions. Regular Expressions are mainly used for string manipulation and can be used to detect patterns in text. Regex (for short) is commonly used in various programming languages to parse through large amounts of text data to obtain the relevant information. For example, websites may use regex to test whether your password contains the relevant characters. In this part of this document, you'll be exposed to regex in R. Now, as a psychology/non-programming student, you may be wondering how this may be useful to you. But regex can be used in variety of ways. For example, you may use regex to extract certain adjectives from a body of text. Or you may wish to automate positive or negative words while parsing through thousands of reviews or reddit posts. I personally use regex to parse through large number of columns through some key words and restrictions. Additionally, you can use regex to remove unwanted text/whitespace from your strings, detect patterns in text and much more. If that didn't convince you to learn this powerful tool, know that you can use regex in other tools such as microsoft word or google documents to detect patterns of words and replace them in a quick and efficent manner.</p>

            <li>str_extract() can be used to extract letters based off patterns. The resulting output could be a vector or a list.</li>
            <pre class="code">str_extract(c('i love R', 'R'), 'love')</pre>
            <li>str_replace() can be used to replace strings based off a pattern.</li>

        <h2 class="nav-title">Regex Tutorial in R</h2>
        <p class="para">To evaluate regualar expression in R, we'll primarily be utilizing the <code>str_view()</code> function. As it allows you to see what letters are being matched. 
        I've linked a little helper function that allows you to evaluate the matched strings and practice. There are a variety of special characters in regex that allow you to match certain patterns. In R, you have to double escape most of these special characters, I've listed them below.</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>The "." pattern will match any character in R, be it a letter, number, special character. For example, in the first case, "." matches the first letter. In the second case, the "." matches a number and in the final case the "." pattern matches a bracket.</li>
            <pre class="code">str_view("Hello", pattern = ".")
str_view("123", pattern = ".")
str_view("()", pattern = ".")</pre>
            <li>To directly match certain characters such as ".", ",", ")" etc. You have to escape the characters. In R, we escape characters by using the "\\" before the chosen character. </li>
            <pre class="code">str_view("Hello!", "\\!")
str_view("Hello.", "\\.")
str_view("Hello)", "\\)")</pre>
            </pre>
            <li>
                The "^" pattern matches the beginning of a string. For example, in the first case, the "^" pattern matches the beginning of the string "Hello". In the second case, the "$" pattern matches the end of the string "123".</li>
            <pre class="code">
str_view("Hello", pattern = "^")
str_view("123", pattern = "$")</pre>
            <li> The "|" pattern matches either of the two patterns. For example, in the first case, the "|" pattern matches either "Hello" or "123". In the second case, the "|" pattern matches either "Hello" or "123" or "Hello123".</li>
            <pre class="code">
str_view("Hello123", pattern = "Hello|123")
str_view("Hello123", pattern = "Hello|123|Hello123")</pre>
            <li> The "*" pattern matches zero or more of the preceding pattern. For example, in the first case, the "*" pattern matches zero or more of the preceding pattern "a" and the "." matches the next letter "b". In the second case, the "*" pattern matches zero or more of the preceding pattern "a" and the "." matches the next letter "b".</li>
            <pre class="code">
'aabc' %>% str_view("a*.")
'bc' %>% str_view("a*.")</pre>
            <li> The "+" pattern matches one or more of the preceding pattern. For example, in the first case, the "+" pattern matches one or more of the preceding pattern "a" and the "." matches the next letter "p". In the second case, the "+" pattern matches one or more of the preceding pattern "a", in this case, none exist so the pattern fails to match anything. </li>
            <pre class="code">
'aaapple' %>% str_view("a+.")
'kiwi' %>% str_view("a+.")</pre>
            <li> The "?" pattern matches zero or one of the preceding pattern. For example, in the first case, the "?" pattern matches zero or one of the preceding pattern "a" and the "." matches the next letter "p". In the second case, the "?" pattern matches zero of the preceding pattern "a" and the "." matches the next letter "p".</li>
            <pre class="code">
'apple' %>% str_view("a?.")
'pple' %>% str_view("a?.")</pre>
            <li> The "{}" pattern matches a specific number of the preceding pattern. For example, in the first case, the "{}" pattern matches 3 of the preceding pattern "a" and the "." matches the next letter "p". In the second case, the "{}" pattern matches 2 of the preceding pattern "a" and the "." matches the next letter "p".</li>
            <pre class="code">
'aaapple' %>% str_view("a{3}.")
'aaapple' %>% str_view("a{2}.")</pre>
            <li> The "{}" pattern can also be used to match a range of the preceding pattern. For example, in the first case, the "{}" pattern matches 2 to 3 of the preceding pattern "a" and the "." matches the next letter "p". In the second case, the "{}" pattern matches 1 to 2 of the preceding pattern "a" and the "p" matches the next letter "p".</li>
            <pre class="code">
'aaapple' %>% str_view("a{2,3}.")
'aaapple' %>% str_view("a{1,2}p")</pre>
            <li> The "[]" pattern matches any of the characters within the brackets. For example, in the first case, the "[]" pattern matches any of the characters "a", "b" or "c" and the "." matches the next letter "p". In the second case, the "[]" pattern matches any of the characters "a" and "p". The final example showcases how you can specify ranges such as [A-Z], [a-z] and [1-9] to select all letters and numbers.</li>
            <pre class="code">
'aaapple' %>% str_view("[a].")
'aaapple' %>% str_view_all("[ap].")
'ABCabc123' %>% str_view_all("[A-Za-z0-9]")
</pre>
            <li> The "()" pattern groups patterns together. For example, in the first case, the "()" pattern groups the "a", "a" and "p" patterns together. In the second case, the "()" pattern groups the "a" and "p" patterns together and the "." matches the next letter "p".</li>
            <pre class="code">
'aaapple' %>% str_view("(aap)")
'aaapple' %>% str_view("(ap.)")</pre>
            <li> Additionally, there are certain special characters that allow you to match certain patterns in regex. For example, "\\w" will match any word, "\\s" will match any space character, "\\b" will match a boundary, "\\d" will match a number and "[:punct:]" will match all punctuations. Similarly, using an uppercase of any of these special characters works as a negation or a "anything but". For example, "\\W" will match anything except a letter. </li>
            <pre class="code">
'apple' %>% str_view("\\w")
'apple!!' %>% str_view("\\W")
'Red Apple' %>% str_view("\\s")
'Red Apple' %>% str_view("\\S")
'apple' %>% str_view("\\b")
'apple' %>% str_view("\\B")
'5 Apples' %>% str_view("\\d")
'5 Apples' %>% str_view("\\D")
'apple!!' %>% str_view("[:punct:]")
</pre>
        </ul>

</pre>
        <p class="para">This regular expression pattern matches any string of digits (\\d{1,}) separated by dashes (\\-). The curly braces {1,} after each \\d means that there must be at least one digit before or after the dash.
            The regular expression is looking for sequences of digits separated by dashes. This is a common pattern for phone numbers, which is why the function is able to match the phone numbers in the given string.</p> 
        <p class="para">String = "My email is example@example.com and my friend's email is friend@gmail.com" <br> Match the emails.</p>
        <pre class="code">
str_view_all("My email is example@example.com and my friend's email is friend@gmail.com", pattern = "(\\w*[:punct:]){2}\\w*")
</pre>
        <p class="para">The first part of the pattern ((\\w*[:punct:])) matches any word characters (\\w*) followed by any punctuation ([:punct:]) and the curly braces {2} after that mean that there must be two of these combined parts.</p>
        <p class="para">String = "cat, bat, rat, cart, cat, cut" <br> Match all the words that start with "c" and end with "t".</p>
        <pre class="code">
str_view_all("cat, bat, rat, cart, cat, cut", pattern = "c.*t")
</pre>
        <p class="para">In this case the c matches the first letter (you can also fix it with an anchor ^) and the .* matches 0 or more of the second letter while the string finishes with the letter "t".</p>
        <p class="para">Match the letters after the word "the" <br> String "Today is the day I figure out how to solve the problem."</p>
        <pre class="code">
str_view_all("Today is the day I figure out how to solve the problem.", pattern = "the\\s\\w*") </pre>
        <p class="para">While the first solution works, it also matches the letter "the". A more elegent solution would utilize a look back function "(?&lt;=)"</p>
        <pre class="code">
str_view_all("Today is the day I figure out how to solve the problem.", pattern = "(?&lt;=the\\s)\\w*") </pre>
        <p class="para">In this case, the (?&lt;=) pattern allows us to match everything after a certain character which in our case is "the" and a space, hence the inclusion of "\\s".
             Outside the parantheses is what you want to match. Which in our case is a word.</p>

        <p class = "para">This code is using the rsDriver and the Rselenium package in R to control a web browser (specifically, Google Chrome version 108.0.5359.22) through a server-client connection. It is then navigating to the search page on "www.ratemyprofessors.com" to search for teachers by query. The code is closing the cookie pop-up and then clicks the 'show more' button to load more professors in the search result. With this code, you can use the same pattern to navigate to different pages and interact with the web page elements using the findElement function and the clickElement function. Finally, it is accesing the html source that allows us to scrape the data using other software such as Rvest.</p>
    <h2 class="nav-title">httr (Optional)</h2>
        <p class="para">
            The httr package in R is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests and working with web APIs. Here's a brief tutorial on how to use it:

            First, you'll need to install the package if you haven't already. You can do this by running the following command in your R console:</p>
    <pre class = "code"> install.packages("httr")</pre>
            
           <p class = "para"> Next, load the package by running the following command:</p>
    <pre class = "code"> library(httr) </pre>
            <p class = "para">
            The most basic function in the package is GET(), which is used to make a GET request to a specified URL.
            For example, to get the HTML of the Google's homepage, you would use the following command:
        </p>
            <pre class = "code">
response <- GET("https://www.google.com")</pre>
            <p class = "para">You can also add additional parameters to the request such as headers, query parameters, and the body of the request by using the add_headers(), add_query(), and body() functions respectively.
            For example, to add a query parameter to the request:</p>
            <pre class = "code">response <- GET("https://api.example.com/search", add_query("q", "example query"))</pre>
            
            <p class = "para">To check the status of the response and access the content, you can use the status_code(), content(), and headers() functions, respectively.
            For example, to check the status code of the response:</p>
            <pre class = "code">status_code(response)</pre>
            <p class = "para">
            To extract data from the response, you can use content() function and parse it using jsonlite package or xml2 package depending on the format of the response.
            For example, to parse the response as json:</p>
            <pre class = "code">
data <- content(response, as = "json")
            </pre>
            <p class = "para">
            The package also includes functions for other types of requests such as POST(), PUT(), DELETE() etc.
            And that's it! With httr package you can send different types of requests and work with different types of responses from web APIs in R.

              The nest_level is set to 1 which means it will only scrape top-level comments.
              The delay parameter is set to 1 second, this is to avoid the limits of how frequently you can access the API and avoid "bad gateway" error.

                    <p class="para">
    To use this code, you will first need a Twitter developer account. You can apply for one at 
                      <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access" target = "_blank">https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access</a>. Once you have an account, you will need to create an app. Then, copy and paste your API/access information into the following code:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="code">
appname <- "your-app-name"
